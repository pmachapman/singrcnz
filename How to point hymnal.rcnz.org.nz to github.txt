In summary:
 - Get the RCNZ DNS manager to create a DNS A-record to point hymnal.rcnz.org.nz to the IP addresses for github.io
   (four of them at the time of writing; you can find them by doing nslookup github.io)
 - In the respository settings tab in github, search for "Custom Domain" and set it to hymnal.rcnz.org.nz
